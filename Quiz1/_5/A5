Since we are provided with embedded systems, "which is a microprocessor or microcontroller bassed system of hardware and software designed to perform dedicated functions within a larger mechanical or electrical system." (https://www.omnisci.com/technical-glossary/embedded-systems)

According to me we should use the real mode (16-bit mode) for running your program, because the embedded system is a dedicated system for small programs like simple arithmetic.

But if we use 64 bit mode it will use the protected mode which will then use some concepts like paging and virtual memory which I am not very clear about, but I know from an abstract level that it will take time leading to an overhead so I will use real mode.
